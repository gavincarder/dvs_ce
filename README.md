# What is OData Dynamic Virtual Services?

The OData Dynamic Virtual Services (DVS) allows model driven creation of Service Virtualizations emulating an OData service that run under CA Service Virtualization (formerly CA-LISA).

With limited exceptions as noted in the documentation, the Service Virtualizations created with DVS provide full support at the OData Minimal Conformance Level for an updatable 
OData v4 service, as well as a significant number of intermediate and Advanced features.   Legacy Odata v3 compliance is provided with exceptions as noted.

Data will persist so long as the Virtual Service is running, and a REST API is provided to allow data to be saved and restored to known points across Virtual Service shutdowns. 

The OData Virtual Service Model can be defined from a RAML file, or by directly creating or editing an XML configuration file referred to as an AEDM.

DVS functionality may be accessed either through an Eclipse plug-in, or a REST API provided by Servlet which can be hosted under Tomcat.
   
See the documentation for full list of features, and installation instructions.

README.txt contains the list of defects currently known.

## Pre-requisites

The OData Virtual Services created run in a CA Service Virtualization (CA LISA) 7.5, or 8.0 Virtual Service Environment which have the “CA Service Virtualization OData Extension” installed.

DVS Eclipse plug-in requires Eclipse (surprise!), and has been tested using the Kepler distribution.

DVS Servlet war has been tested using Tomcat Webserver version 7.0.57. 

Building from source using the build procedure provided will require 3rd Party Components as listed in the build instructions.
